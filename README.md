# Lucifer discord bot
Bot for discord, my own making. I will refer to the discord client from now on as Satan and the bot itself as Lucifer for simplicity's (and fun's) sake.

## Freatures

### Song playing and queuing

+ Song playing

   You can use the command play to make Satan join your channel and play the requested url or query to search on youtube, from which it will play the first result.
   
   Furthermore, you can queue a song to be played next to the last one called using the same command, no additional requirements.
   
+ Pause, resume and skip

   Fair enough, you can pause, resume paused players and skip a song.
   
+ Join and leave

   Satan can leave or join your channel on command.

+ Playlist functions

   You can create a playlist unique in your server, meaning you can only access playlists created from within your server and there can't be two playlists with the same name in your server. You can also delete playlists from your server.
   
   Calling the playlist command will add to the queue all of the songs contained by the playlist, wich you can add with the add_to_playlist command, you should also be able to remove songs from a playlist **[_WIP_]**. Again, all of this only to your servers playlists.
   
### Event managing
**_DISCLAIMER_:** This function was very specifically made for my discord server I have with my university partners, you can simply not load the cog or change/remove some functions. You can also change the images in the images folder.
